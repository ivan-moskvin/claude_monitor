Usage:

  claudestatus divoom off          turn the panel off and give the screen its clock face back
  claudestatus divoom              keep the panel updated (works while running)
  claudestatus divoom once         send the panel once and exit
  claudestatus divoom screen [N]   show or take over screen 1–5
  claudestatus divoom preview FILE save a frame to a file without touching the device
